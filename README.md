![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rlawton2/Factory-Example/master/Banner1.png)

## Description
This small project demonstates the use of the factory design pattern and some class hierarchy.

## Project Details
The factory design allows objects to be created at runtime without knowing what the exact class of the object will be. It utilizes a parent class or interface as a reference type and a "factory" class to determine the class the object. Also, in the program are some examples of downcasting and conversion to child reference types. This could be useful if you would like to store the objects in specific collections, etc.
